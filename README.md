there are a few errors I didn't manage to fix in time.

1. The profile page sometimes doesn't show the photo you uploaded. When that happens, click "HOME" and then "PROFILE" again, then it works. I have no idea why. 
2. The image itself doesn't show up. The problem most likely is in the python I wrote in the profile.html page, because I couldn't find a website that explained the syntax.
3. If you are not signed in, and click "PROFILE" it will crash. I tried to work around it with redirecting when the user is not signed in, but it didn't work. 

and i think that's it :)
